The dataset includes 4424 images.
Weapons-gun-knife-person are annotated in YOLOv12 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
